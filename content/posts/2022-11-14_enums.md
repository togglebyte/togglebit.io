Draft notes:

* enum size
* alignment
* discriminant
* discriminant size

Notes about the discriminant size: even thought the size is the same size as a
`usize` (a "word") the discriminant can be optimised away (see below).

The discriminant can be larger than the alignment, e.g by using `#[repr(u128)]`
(this is nightly only right now).

* To enable `repr(u128)` add `#![feature(repr128)]`.

If the discriminant size is smaller than the padding, then any data after
the size but inside the alignment is "garbage data".

## Bytes

Given the 

To see some "garbage data":

```rust
enum Choice {
    A(String),
}
```

* If an enum only has one variant, there is no discriminant. I.e all the bytes
  represent that variant

## Some cool tricks in regards to layout:

Looking at an enum like the one below we can see that it has three variants: A and B.
`A` contains a `Vec<u8>`, and the size of a vector is 24 bytes (on a 64 bit system), 
since its composed of a pointer (8 bytes), capacity (8 bytes) and size (8 bytes).

```rust
enum Choice {
    A(Vec<u8>),
    B,
}
```

We can easily imagine that the size of the enum is then 32 bytes: 28 bytes for
the vector, and one byte for the discriminant. 
This is however not the case.
Because the first eight bytes in the vector is a pointer, and that pointer can
never be zero, the compiler can reserve `0` for `Choice::B`.
This means when we are looking at the bytes for the enum, if the first byte is
not zero it means the variant is `A`, anything else means it's 'B'.

This is called Null Pointer Optimisation, because the pointer in the vector can
never be zero or one.

## Repr and size

If `#[repr]` is set, then the discriminant is never optimised away.
