Awaiting a task will block until it's complete.
In the following code: `x` is first completed, then `y`

```rust
let x = some_task().await;
let y = some_other_task().await;
```

## Runtime (you need one)

To create a runtime use

```rust
async some_task() -> u32 {
    123
}

let runtime = tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap();
let value = runtime.block_on(some_task());
```

## Spawning tasks and `join`

`spawn` can be considered analogous to `std::thread::spawn`.
Spawning a task returns a `Future` (that can be `await`ed).
There is no guarantee that a `spawn`ed tasks ends up on the same
thread as another `spawn`ed task (unless it's on a single threaded runtime)

* `join!` is local which means tasks that are `!Send` are possible.
* `spawn(some_future())` is spawned into a task pool.

```rust
async get_number() -> u32 {
    5
}

async no_spawn() -> *const () {
    &()
}

async fn use_join() -> u32 {
    // join three futures
    let (a, b, c) = tokio::join!(get_number(), get_number(), no_spawn());
    a + b
}
```

## Networking comments

For reading / writing use `tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt}`.

```rust
async fn handle_socket(mut s: TcpStream) -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut buf = [0u8; 64];
    let res = s.read(&mut buf).await?;
    s.write(&buf[..res]).await?;
    Ok(())
}
```
