## Overview and "why"

There are many reasons to create a virtual machine, ranging from sandboxed
runtime to exploration and education.

This is written with the intent to better understand how a basic CPU works, where
variables end up and how it performs various operations.

This is all based on a project called LC3 (Little Computer 3)
