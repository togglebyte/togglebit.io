An `eventfd` contains a 32 bit integer maintained by the kernel.

Creating an `eventfd`:

```rust
let init_val = 0;
let flags = libc::EFD_CLOEXEC | libc::EFD_NONBLOCK;
libc::eventfd(init_val, flags);

// Register with libc::EPOLLIN | libc::EPOLLET
```

Write a value greater than zero to an instance of `eventfd` to notify user
space.
Reading it will then reset it to zero.

All other reads will get "Resource Temporarily Unavailable", until it's written
again.
