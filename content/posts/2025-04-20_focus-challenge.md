I issued a challenge to my self ( and my community on Discord ) to see if we
could reclaim some of our stolen focus.

The TL;DR is this: 
see if you can focus on a specific task for a given amount of time each day for
five days.

The goal of this is just a bit of fun but it can also help with getting things done
through pre-commitment.

## The rules

* Use of the browser: only documentation sites (no videos)
* No phone (I set mine to Do Not Disturb, it really helps)
* Music: yes of course (make a playlist even)
* Get up and stretch is fine, but don't engage in another activity
 
**Notes for clever clogs and smarty pants:**

* Yes of course you can use the bathroom, you lark
* If you are doing mobile dev or web dev then of course you have to use the
  browser / phone, the point is that you don't use it to browse social media or
  drown your brain in YouTube videos.

## Set a timer for when you start:

- Day 1: 30 min
- Day 2: 30 min
- Day 3: 45 min
- Day 4: 45 min
- Day 5: 60 min

If you get distracted don't give up,
note down what distracted you and how far into the countdown you were, so you can track your distractions.

Find a task / project to work on and post your daily summary either on our
Discord or on Bluesky (I use `#focuschallenge`).

The format of the post:

```
Day #
Working on: <task>
Number of interruptions #
Did you manage the entire time: yes / no (only answer "no" if you gave up before the time ran out)
```

E.g
```
Day 1
Working on: a text layout engine in Rust
Number of interruptions: 3
Did you manage the entire time: yes
```

Good luck!
