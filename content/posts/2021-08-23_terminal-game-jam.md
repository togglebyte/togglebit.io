## Important note: 

Even though the URL has the word "game" in it, your submission doesn't have to be a game!
The idea started out as a game jam but quickly changed to be more generic, however the url was already posted
on various places.

## Overview

- Length: 2 days (Weekend)
- Voting: Starts Monday 6th of Sept, ends Wednesday 8th of Sept

- Project has to have a README file explaining what it does (note in here if you don't want the code on
  stream).
