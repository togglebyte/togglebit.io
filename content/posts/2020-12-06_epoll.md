Epoll can be used directly via [libc](https://crates.io/crates/libc).

## Notes

`int_c = i32`

## Creating and closing an Epoll instance

Note that this is using `epoll_create1` instead of `epoll_create`.
`epoll_create` takes a size argument, however this is ignored by the kernel
(unless you have a kernel older than 2.6.8).

`epoll_create1` takes a flag, which for now can be either `0` or
`libc::EPOLL_CLOEXEC`.

### Create

```rust
let res = libc::epoll_create1(flags);

if res < 0 {
    return Err(
        io::Error::from_raw_os_error(-fd)
    );
}

let file_descriptor = res;
```

### Close

```rust
let res = libc::close(fd);

if res < 0 {
    return Err(
        io::Error::from_raw_os_error(-res)
    );
}
```

## Registering an event

Events can be added (modified or removed) with the system call
`libc::epoll_ctl`.

Adding an entry to the interest list requires the file descriptor for the epoll
instance, the operator `EPOLL_CTL_ADD`, the file descriptor associated with the
interest (e.g a socket, stdin etc.) as well as an `epoll_event`.

The `epoll_event` has two fields:

* `events` tells epoll what events to listen for
* `u64` is a user defined value that will be returned with the event.

```rust
let mut event = libc::epoll_event {
    events: libc::EPOLLIN as _,
    u64: 0,                 // User defined value associated with the entry
};

let res = libc::epoll_ctl(
    epoll_fd,               // epoll instance
    libc::EPOLL_CTL_ADD,    // Operation, in this case Add
    fd,                     // file descriptor (e.g a socket, stdin etc.)
    &mut event as *mut libc::epoll_event,
);
```

## Wait for events

Setting `timeout` to `-1` will block until an event is received.

Previous code block registered a read interest for `stdin`, which is assumed
here.

```rust
use std::os::unix::io::FromRawFd;
use std::io::Read;
use std::fs::File;

// Init the vec with some events. It doesn't matter what we put here
// as it will be overwritten by epoll.
let mut events = vec![
    libc::epoll_event { event: 0, u64: 0 },
    libc::epoll_event { event: 0, u64: 0 },
    libc::epoll_event { event: 0, u64: 0 },
];

let mut stdin = File::from_raw_fd(0); // see previous code block
let mut buffer = [0u8;10];

loop {
    let event_count = libc::epoll_wait(
        epoll_fd,               // epoll instance
        events.as_mut_ptr(),    // mutable pointer to events
        events.len() as i32,
        1_000,                  // timeout in milliseconds
    );

    for i in 0..event_count as usize {
        let event = &events[i];
        let num_bytes_read = stdin.read(&mut buffer).unwrap();
        let data = &buffer[..num_bytes_read];
    }
}
```

## Edge triggered and one-shot events

When requesting a one-shot event, epoll will not notify of any subsequent
events after being notified of one, unless the interest entry is updated:

```rust
libc::epoll_ctl(
    epoll_fd,
    libc::EPOLL_CTL_MOD,    // Re-register interest
    0,                      // stdin
    &mut event as &mut libc::epoll_event,
)
```
